# LW3_v1.0
New features:
1) Two strategies are studied 
2) Given algorithms were already used in previous version
3) Program could be optimized with implementation of "auto" data type (did not find the correct place for -fconcept parameter)


# LW3-v0.5
New features:
1) Program was fully rewriten to analyze any other data file chosen by user
2) Only files with 6 marks are supported
3) Speeds of 3 different containers are analyzed (vector, deque, list)
4) Exception handling was added for filename mistakes, for mark errors it is not working correctly


# LW3_v0.4

New features:
1) Program is able to generate 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 number of student lists stored in separate files 
2) Students are sorted in terms of passing and failing the course (2 more files are generated)
3) Ability to track code speed at different segments
4) Deriving more functions to simplify the code
5) Exception handling is done at it's finest


# LW3-v0.3

New features:
1) Converting a part of the code into separate functions (improvement expected later on)
2) The program was divided into separate files (new header and cpp files were created)
3) Preliminar exception handling methods were introduced (looking forward further improvement)


# LW3-v0.2

New features:
1) Program is able to read data from previously created file
2) Student list is sorted by surnames 
3) Components of the table are aligned

# LW3-v0.1-

Program has:
1) Student name and surname by user input
2) Homework and exam marks by user input
3) Homework's mark also as additional student can be dynamically added
4) Final points are calculated according the formula for average and median values 
5) Function to randomize homework and exam marks
6) The results are represented in a table

Dynamic memory allocation was implemented by vector object means. Array is left in undynamic state (the work is still in progress).
